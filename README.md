### Our solution for the Xerox Research Innovation Challenge 2016.
The aim was to predict risk of death (mortality) in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) within hospitals, given
the time-series data of 6 Vitals and 25 Lab Investigations as variables.
- Extracted relevant statistical features from these variables and used the AdaBoost boosting with decision tree as the weak learners.
- Achieved **sensitivity = 0.352, specificity = 0.989** and **accuracy = 0.945** on final evaluation.
